Tutorial: https://vimeo.com/839277293/a5871c08bf


Issues:


1. How to check orders placed via BOB
2. Check if an order is prepaid or COD
3. Order data isn't being fetched
4. Customer made payment successfully but order not created
5. Order from WhatsApp but no Payment received - showing confirmation
6. Discount was not applied on an order placed by the customer.


Solutions:


For Issue 1: How to check orders placed via BOB


Dashboard > Orders


For Issue 2: Check if an order is prepaid or COD


Go to Order Confirmation Notification > Message log > Enter the order no/customer no > Message Status or go to Transcripts and check the chat.


For Issue 3: Order data isn't being fetched


Let the customer know only bot orders will be fetched on this data range.


Change the calendar date filter and check as well


If the client insists the data is inaccurate, raise a CRB.


For Issue 4: Customer pay payment successfully but order not created


Check their shopify and cross-check if the order has been created.
* If not created, raise a CRB.
* If created, follow the following steps.


If an order is created and an order confirmation notification is not sent, this could be because the client has set the post-purchase recommendation as 0 hours. That means the recommendation message will be sent instead of Order confirmation (this is exclusive only for website paid orders).


For Issue 5: Order from WhatsApp but no Payment received - showing confirmation


Check the customer’s transcript, find the checkout link for the order. Go to the link and you can see the payment proof.


Send the payment proof to the client.


If there is no payment proof, create a CRB.


For Issue 6: Discount was not applied on an order placed by the customer


Go to the Transcripts of the customer and open the payment link, check if the discount has been applied by checking the amount the customer paid. If it is a discounted price, share the payment screenshot to the client.

For Issue 1: Unable to send messages


* Ask the contact number of the customer 


* Check if the customer is in an active 24 window session( from the time when customer sent the last message)


* If Not - then send the below reply to client
When a user initiates the session it is valid for 24 hours(from the time when the user sent the last message). Once the session expires the brand can only initiate a new conversation/session by sending a template message. Once a user responds to the message, again the session will be valid for 24 hours.
Note: You can suggest the steps in point 4.
* If Yes - Check if you are able to send normal message from dashboard If still fetching error then raise a CRB to tech team stating Unable to send messages even if customer is in active 24 hours window session Also Note: If its an International Number and the Client’s provider is Gupshup, they might not have International messaging enabled for them. Confirm with the client if they’d like international messaging enabled and let them there’ll be additional charges depending on the country. If they’d like to go ahead with International messaging, raise a ticket to Gupshup and ask to whitelist the countries the client would like to send international messaged to.


For Issue 2: Unable to chat with customer        


* Ask the Contact number of the user
* Check if the user is in waiting window

6. No products showing up
7. Products have lots of error
8. Not able to sync Catalog 
9. The updates I have made to my Product Arrangement Sheet are not being reflected on WhatsApp


Steps to Resolve 1-4 Issues:


1. Initiate a catalog synchronization to address price, image, and new product updates.
2. Perform a catalog sync and verification.
3. If the issues persist, proceed with the following steps.


Steps to Resolve 5-6 Issues:


1. Check if the missing products are part of collection in the Commerce Flow (CF sheet).
   - If not present, inform the client to add the missing products to the designated collection.
   - If products are listed in the CF, proceed to the next steps.
2. Verify if the product exists in the catalog sheet.
   - If absent, conduct a catalog sync and recheck for the product.
   - If the product is found, proceed with the provided CURL command to send the catalog message to the designated WhatsApp (WA) number.
3. After sending the catalog message, verify if the product has been received.
   - If received, check the commerce flow in WA to ensure functionality.
   - If the product is not received, further investigation is necessary on Facebook Business Manager (FBM) to check for potential product rejections by the commerce manager.
If issues persist, and the product is not being sent, raise a BUG report.


   - Note: Wait for 1 hour after catalog sync for changes to reflect on FBM.

    },
    "messaging_product": "whatsapp"
}'


Note: Replace 'D360-API-KEY', 'catalog_id', and 'product_retailer_id' with the appropriate values.

Ask for the contact number of the user who is facing this issue. Check if the user is in Agent chat. If the user is in Agent, bot will not respond to any buttons. Once user types # and come out of agent chat, bot will work as expected.


Check by sending the message to bot of the brand. If you don't receive any messages. Type # and then again type Hi and send to bot if still not receiving welcome message, then raise a CRB to tech team stating bot is not responding and flag the jira ticket on cs-engineering channel

Bot CSAT (Customer Satisfaction score) refers to a measure of customer satisfaction score.It is a metric used to gauge the effectiveness and performance of a bot in meeting customer needs and expectations. Bot CSAT is typically calculated by asking customers to rate their experience with the bot on a scale, such as from 1 (highly unsatisfied) to 5 (highly satisfied). 


            For Issue 2: How to download the Bot CSAT report?


Kindly click on Bot configuration >> Bot Responses >> Bot CSAT >> Download (You can select custom date and download the csv file)


            For Issue 3: Why Bot CSAT messages are not going to the customer?

3. Checkout


Issues:


1. What is the difference between standard and fast checkout?
2. Why was Fast Checkout charged when it is not enabled?
3. Why are there three addresses during checkout?
4. We are not getting checkout links today on whatsapp


Solutions:


For Issue 1: What is the difference between standard and fast checkout?


* Standard Checkout - Standard Checkout will display only addresses where their customers have previously placed orders within your brand. If no previous orders have been placed, a new address form will be shown.


* Fast Checkout - The fast checkout feature accesses a database of over 20 million addresses. If a brand's customers have ordered from any of the fast checkout enabled brands before, their address will be automatically displayed, allowing for rapid checkout. This can improve the checkout experience for their customers by streamlining the process and making it more efficient. Also, we charge 2.5% on orders placed on bot but this commission varies depending on the client’s subscription.


For Issue 2: Why was Fast Checkout charged when it is not enabled?


* Check their dashboard if it has been enabled or not
* If enabled, tell them it had already been configured and they had used it. If they insist they never wanted this feature, talk to their BOB POC and find out more.
* If disabled, check with accounts as to why they were charged extra and apologize to the client


For Issue 3: Why are there three addresses during checkout?


The three addresses shown are addresses that the customer has previously placed an order on.


For Issue 4: We are not getting checkout links today on whatsapp

Issues:


1. How to create coupon code on dashboard.
2. We have created a coupon code on the website. Can we apply the same coupon code on the dashboard and apply on bot?
3. We have created coupon on dashboard, but unable to apply through assisted sales
4. Coupon codes which were created long back are now not getting applied on bot.
5. BoB should not share the coupon code to customers who have shown interest in these specific products which are not included in these coupon
6. if we create a coupon for which we are not doing any campaign for the customer to know about it. How will customers know about it?
7. Can you help me understand how to create the available offer button with the welcome message and how to mention the coupon code there?
8. How to edit expired coupon code?
9. We want to create the same coupon with different conditions but because a coupon with the same name was created (but has expired now) it's not allowing the creation, how to do it?
10. Can we create a BUY X GET Y feature? It's there on shopify but not available on whatsapp dashboard.
11. We need a discount option wherein the discount gets auto applied while checking out without the need of any discount coupon similar to what is available on shopify. How can we do that?
12. How to create coupon codes for woocommerce brands?
13. Some random coupons are coming on clicking ‘Available Coupons’.


Solutions:


            For Issue 1: How to create coupon code on dashboard.


Kindly click on Bot responses >> Checkout >> Coupon code >> Create coupon code as per requirement>> save.


For Issue 2: We have created a coupon code on the website. Can we apply the same coupon code on the dashboard and apply on bot?


If the coupon code is created on shopify backend, then you need to create the same coupon code on BOB dashboard to continue with the checkout on WhatsApp itself. If the customer applies the Shopify Coupon at the time of checkout, then they’ll get the Shopify checkout link.


For Issue 3: We have created coupon on dashboard, but unable to apply through assisted sales


If the coupon code is created only on BOB dashboard, then coupon cannot be applied through assisted sales. If the same coupon is there on shopify backend and still not able to use it through assisted sales, then raise a CRB to the tech team.


For Issue 4: Coupon codes which were created long back are now not getting applied on bot.


Check the coupon code is still active on the dashboard. Check if the coupons are getting applied on bot. If not then raise a CRB to the tech team


For Issue 5: BoB should not share the coupon code to customers who have shown interest in these specific products which are not included in these coupon


Check if specific products are there on shopify backend under that particular coupon code. If yes, then tell the same to the client as it is configured to give a discount to those specific products. Kindly remove those specific products from the coupon code and BOB will not share the coupon on those products. 
If those products are not there then raise a CRB to the tech team.


For Issue 6: if we create a coupon for which we are not doing any campaign for the customer to know about it. How will customers know about it?


There are many ways through which customers will come to know about the coupon code.
​
1. You can mention the coupon code  in welcome message
2. You can mention the coupon code through Abandoned cart Notification.
3. You can also launch a campaign with the coupon code and the offer that you are running.
4. You can add a button in a welcome message like " Available offers" where once the customer clicks on it, they will get to know all the available offers or coupons.


For Issue 7: Can you help me understand how to create the available offer button with the welcome message and how to mention the coupon code there?


You can create a flow with a trigger phase as " Available offer" and then you can mention all the available offers or coupons in the journey of the flow.
​
Also, you need to create a button as " Available offer" or the same which you mention as the trigger phase of the flow as a button in the welcome message. So that once the user clicks on the button the flow which you have created will start and the user will get to know about the coupon or available offer.


            For Issue 8: How to edit expired coupon code?


A coupon cannot be edited once it has been created or expired. Only the expiry time can be edited before the coupon has expired.


For Issue 9: We want to create the same coupon with different conditions but because a coupon with the same name was created (but has expired now) it's not allowing the creation, how to do it?


You can create a coupon code with the same name by deleting the old coupon code. Make sure that you download the report for each coupon code, so that you have the analytics of all of them.




For Issue 10 :Can we create a BUY X GET Y feature? It's there on shopify but not available on whatsapp dashboard.
We have the feature where we can create a BxGy coupon code. We can create it from the backend. We have not enabled it on the dashboard as there are some limitations of this coupon on the bot. Hence, we do this only on client's requirement.




​Please note the below points:
1. The coupon will not get applied on the bot automatically. Customers need to manually apply the coupon code at the checkout.
2. Customers need to add both the products ( X and Y ) in their cart to apply this coupon code.




For Issue 11: We need a discount option wherein the discount gets auto applied while checking out without the need of any discount coupon similar to what is available on shopify. How can we do that?


As of now we don't have the feature for auto applying of coupon codes on the bot. We have already raised this with our product team to work on it and implement the same in the near future. (Raise NFR)
​
You can create 2 kinds of coupons from your dashboard.
​
1. Amount off order - To give discount on total order value
1. Amount off products - To give a discount on purchase of specific products.
​
We will inform you once we have implemented the feature.


            For Issue 12: How to create coupon codes for woocommerce brands?


If the coupon code already exists on your woocommerce, then you can't create the coupon with the same name on BOB dashboard. To resolve, you can either delete the existing coupon code on woocommerce and then create the same from the BOB dashboard. This will automatically create the same coupon code on your woocommerce as well.


            For Issue 13: Some random coupons are coming on clicking ‘Available Coupons’.


Check the coupon code on dashboard and shopify, if it is a different coupon code then raise CRB to the tech team. 


Coupon codes are not enabled for Custom stores

Issues:


1. How to turn off Loyalty points?
2. Reward points given to canceled order
3. How to redeem the loyalty points?
4. Points not credited for last two orders


Solutions:


For Issue 1: How to turn off Loyalty points?


To turn off loyalty points, disable all the messages that have been set up in Loyalty > Settings > Message Configuration


Also turn the rewards widget off.


For Issue 2: Reward points given to canceled order


Check Shopify/Woocommerce if the order is indeed canceled, there’s a high chance that it has not. We do not give reward points for canceled orders.


If the order has indeed been canceled in their website backend and the rewards points were still given, raise a CRB.


For Issue 3: How to redeem the loyalty points?


Loyalty points can only be redeemed when placing an order. The agent also has the ability to convert loyalty points to a discount code for the customer as well.


For Issue 4: Points not credited for last two orders


* Loyalty points are awarded after the order has been delivered. It should be marked as delivered by the shipping partner on the client’s website, only then will our system send the loyalty points.
* Other issues such as subscription expiry date can also play a role in the loyalty points template not being sent

3. Go to their website, go through their commerce journey and see how their cart is. If the cart page is a separate URL, then raise CRB. If not, then that’s because we need the cart page to go to a separate page for it to work. Let the client know these customers will be targeted with the Product Drop Offs automation.
Flows Builder


Tutorial:  Flows- Single Message: Single Message

             Flows- Campaign: Campaign Flow 


Issues:


1. Customer flow is not working as expected
2. The flow didn’t work after 4 questions
3. Phrases aren't triggering customer flow
4. Flows aren't being triggered properly
5. I'm creating a flow, I need to add two buttons which I have but how do I add the URL or destination.
6. Need help creating flow for meta ads
7. How to create a flow on Utility message?
8. Multiple active Flows but only one is visible
9. I added 30 items to each CTA flow for the bot shop, but only a few are showing up.


Solutions:


For Issue 1 and 2: Customer flow is not working as expected / The flow didn’t work after 4 questions


* If the flow is for a notification, check if the template has been set to “Handle by flow”
* If a specific button is not triggering the rest of the flow, check if the button text has any spaces.
* If there are multiple buttons in a template, then check if a flow has been created for each button by simply clicking on each button.


Overall, firstly understand the customer use-case from A-Z, how they want the flow to interact with the customer and then take appropriate debugging steps.


For Issue 3 and 4: Phrases aren't triggering customer flow / Flows aren't being triggered properly


* Different trigger phrases should be in different trigger brackets, for eg:
  



  



* Check if there is another flow with the same trigger phase, if so, turn it off after gaining permission from the customer.
* Flows will also not be triggered if sent during Agent chat. For example: A flow being triggered with a template, will not work if the template is sent over chat because the number is in agent chat and bot will not respond during Agent Chat.


For Issue 5: I'm creating a flow, I need to add two buttons which I have but how do I add the URL or destination.


* The URL/destination will be embedded in the button for a static URL during template creation.
* For the quick reply button, simply set up a flow where upon clicking the button, the next message is a simple message with the URL/Destination.


For Issue 6:  Need help creating flow for meta ads


* Once the ad is created in their ads manager, using the same template create a flow with the type selected as “Meta Ads”
* After the flow has been set up, go to User Acquisition > Meta Ads > Create the ad campaign > Select the created flow under the dropdown in “Select flow to associate with this ad”.


For Issue 7: How to create a flow on Utility message?


Same process as creating a flow with a marketing template.


For Issue 8: Multiple active Flows but only one is visible


This is a BUG, raise a CRB to tech.


For Issue 9: I added 30 items to each CTA flow for the bot shop, but only a few are showing up.


This is a product catalog issue, continue with debugging steps for Catalog where products aren’t showing up.

13. Getting a red error pop-up when trying to submit a template.
14. Use of custom Url and static url
15. Templates are stuck in drafted state
16. What should I add in the sample variables tab?


Solutions:


For Issue 1 and 2: Please approve my template / Template is approved in META but not on BOB


* After identifying the template name, go to 360/Gupshup and check the template status there.
* If approved, login to the internal dashboard. Change the client name to the requested client and go to Templates. In templates, search for the requested template and click on Status. Change the status to Approved and Save.
* If Pending, contact 360/Gupshup Support and request for the template to be approved. Communicate how our templates get approved within seconds and that this is taking a while. If they reply saying it will take up to 24 hours, relay the same to the client.


For Issue 3: How long does it take for a template to get approved?


Templates will usually take up to a minute to get approved, 15 minutes maximum. If the template is stuck in pending for more than the usual time, contact the appropriate API partner (360/Gupshup) and raise a ticket to their support (follow the steps for Issue 1 resolution)


For Issue 4: How to use variables to show unique customer names?


While creating the template, insert a variable in the body at the desired location. Later on when running the campaign, the excel file used to upload the contacts should have an additional column right after “phone”. This column should have a heading of “1” and then have the names subsequently listed below accordingly matching their phone numbers. For multiple variables, follow the same steps and heading should change accordingly to the variable number.


For Issue 5: How to set up a quick reply template?


* Go to Settings > WhatsApp Templates > Create Template
* Choose the required template category and name.
* On the next page, scroll down to the bottom.
* Click on Button Type > Quick Reply


Also do note, quick reply buttons work according to the trigger phase that is set up in Flow Builder. If the client has a specific message flow in mind for this quick reply button, they have to set up a flow for it.


For Issue 6 to 9: What are the video specifications for templates? / What are the video specifications for templates? / Unable to upload a media header in templates / Unable to add an image when creating a template / Unable to upload a video when creating a template


* When uploading a video as a part of a template, it should be less than 15MB, be in mp4 format, and have a resolution of 940 x 500 pixels.


* When uploading an image as a part of a template, it should be less than 15MB.


* If the video and image specifications are following the above guidelines, try uploading the media header from your end and confirm there is no issue.


* If issue persists, raise a CRB to Tech for further investigation


For Issue 10 to 11: Utility template is being rejected / Why are my templates getting rejected?


Utility Template: 

META is very strict on Utility template guidelines. There should be no promotional content whatsoever in the template for eg: Promotion a product, promising a discount, promoting an upcoming event, these are all considered a form of marketing and will be rejected.


If the utility template is sound and proclaims no promotional or marketing content at all and is still rejected, contact 360 chat and ask them to appeal this decision. 360 will appeal it at META and the process will take 24 hours. Relay the same to the client.


Marketing Template: 

The following link holds the reasons of rejection for a marketing template -


https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/message-templates/guidelines/


For Issue 12 and 13: Not able submit the template, getting meta server error/ Getting a red error pop-up when trying to submit a template


* Try creating creating a template on their dashboard from your end
* If the issue persists, contact 360 about it.


For Issue 14: Use of custom Url and static url


Dynamic URL: This url will allow link tracking and analytics. It can also be used as a variable to send unique urls to different customers.


Static URL: This URL does not allow link analytics.


For Issue 15: Templates are stuck in drafted state


If templates are stuck in a drafted state, check the template via the client’s dashboard. It is in the drafted state because of an error that prohibits it from being submitted. Check this link and cross-check that it is following all of the rules prescribed in it: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/message-templates/guidelines/


For Issue 16: What should I add in the sample variables tab?


Sample Variables tab is to let META know how this specific template will look like when being sent to customers. 


The image sample can be any image.


The variable sample can be similar to the intended use-case, for eg: If {{1}} is intended to show the customer name, type any random name within the variable sample tab.

The above charges are the standard charged, but charges will differ according to the brand’s proposal. Check their proposal either via Freshdesk to find their exact charges or by checking their latest usage invoice.
